The accompanying code comprises a UIView subclass that you can use in your 
iPhone applications to access all basic features of Google Maps (similar to 
Android's MapView). It uses a UIWebView in the background to load the 
HTML/Javascript version of Google Maps, and offers a set of Objective-C 
methods that mimic a subset of the original Javascript methods for controlling 
the map. It currently supports setting the center location, and zooming & 
panning using the touch interface.

Here's a quick description of each included file:

MapView.h/MapView.m         The UIView subclass that encapsulates the 
                            UIWebView running Google Maps. This is the only 
                            class you need to interact with.

MapWebView.h/MapWebView.m   A UIWebView used internally to load Google Maps.
                            You don't have to interact with this class yourself.

All other files             A sample iPhone application showing how to embed 
                            a MapView in your own applications.
